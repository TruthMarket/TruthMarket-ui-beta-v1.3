            <p>
                Throughout thousands of years of human social existence, criminal activities have never ceased, and good people consistently face threats to their financial security and personal safety. Although we have established a sustainable judicial system, power, money, and complex interpersonal relationships have corroded this system, interfering with and manipulating the fairness and justice of the judiciary. Under the influence of power and wealth, attaining a comprehensive truth becomes exceedingly difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
                The networks of interests among wrongdoers are often vast and covert, nearly omnipresent. Unwritten rules enable them to manipulate the judiciary, influence media narratives, and even reverse the roles of victim and perpetrator. This confusion of right and wrong obstructs social justice and civility, fostering an atmosphere of fear. Despite our struggle driven by justice and morality, justice often appears fragile and dispersed in the face of wrongdoing. The cries for justice from good people are frequently ignored, leading to delayed or absent justice.

            <p>
                In our society, the phenomenon of protracted and absent justice is a heart-wrenching yet often overlooked issue. Wrong deeds and injustices that ought to be punished frequently evade consequences due to the obscuring of truth by those in power. The abuse of power blurs the truth, sometimes deliberately distorting it to maintain the status of vested interests. This not only discourages those who dare to speak out but also provides a refuge for wrongdoers to escape accountability.
            </p>
            <p>
                The absence of justice results not only in individual suffering but also profoundly undermines social trust and erodes respect for institutions. Confronted with injustice, many feel powerless and choose silence or avoidance, an emotional response that encourages further injustices and renders society increasingly pathological.

            <h3>
                What can we do?
            </h3>
            <p>
                In the face of these phenomena, we can no longer remain silent. Everyone should recognize their role and responsibility in promoting the realization of justice. We cannot be overwhelmed by the darkness before us; instead, we must strive for the light. Taking action is not just a way to challenge power; it is also a means to defend the truth. We need to establish a transparent and fair platform that encourages others to expose injustice and share the truth, allowing suppressed facts to come to light.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through Truth Market, we aim to provide support and shelter for those who bravely seek the truth and are willing to speak out for justice. Here, they can share their stories, amplify their suppressed voices, and unite to drive social change. We believe that true justice can only be achieved when everyone participates, leading to sustainable social change.
