            <p>
                1, Truth is the most powerful weapon against evil. Truth inherently possesses an undeniable, just, and unifying energy for the human spirit. In the face of truth, good people can become stronger. Only by knowing the truth can we clearly identify the roots of our societal problems, correct and improve social flaws, and drive social progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                2, In any civilized society, truth is the cornerstone of relationships between individuals. It is not only a moral standard but also a guarantee of social stability and harmony. Truth represents transparency and trust; a lack of truth means lies and chaos. In the relationships between individuals and collectives, truth can build bridges of mutual understanding, reduce misunderstandings and conflicts, and promote cooperation and coexistence in society.
            </p>
            <p>
                3, The judicial system in our society can only function effectively based on truth and evidence. Without truth and evidence, criminals will not face the justice they deserve, allowing them to remain at large and causing more harm to others.
            </p>
            <p>
                4, When good people choose silence, it creates fertile ground for wrongdoing. When truth is concealed and justice is ignored, society will fall into endless worry and fear. Conversely, the light of truth will dispel darkness; it empowers goodness and courage, enabling everyone to stand on moral high ground and tirelessly fight for justice.
            </p>
            <p>
                5, Without truth, good people and bad people will always find themselves in a disadvantaged position in their interactions. Good people must consider their principled boundaries, while bad people do not have such constraints, which will continually undermine the healthy functioning of human society.
