            <p>
                To ensure the trading environment and integrity of Truth Market, we have established a blacklist mechanism:
            </p>

            {/* <span className={styles.imageOne}>
                <img src={imageToken} alt="" />
            </span> */}

            <p>
                Truth Box Blacklist Management: If a particular Truth Box is placed on the blacklist, that Box will be unavailable for operation. If a buyer purchases the blacklisted Box, an automatic refund will be processed to protect the buyerâ€™s rights. This mechanism ensures that bad behavior does not affect the overall ecosystem of the platform and provides a legitimate channel for recourse.
            </p>

            <p>
                Through this mechanism, Truth Market provides users with a safe and fair trading environment, laying the foundation for long-term collaboration and trust. We believe that effective deterrence of unlawful behavior and the maintenance of legal and social justice can only be achieved through transparent management.
            </p>
